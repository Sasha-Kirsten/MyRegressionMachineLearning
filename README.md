Energy Efficiency Prediction: Heating Load Analysis

In this analysis, I'll be delving into a dataset related to the energy efficiency of different building shapes. My objective is to predict the heating load of a building based on various features.

Data Inspection and Visualization

Upon loading the dataset, my first step will be to visualize the distribution of the heating load. This will give me a clearer understanding of our target variable.

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing data is crucial. After inspecting the dataset for any missing values, I'll impute them using the median strategy. The choice of median is based on its robustness to outliers compared to the mean.

For building our predictive models, I'll split the data into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%). This will ensure that I have a separate dataset to evaluate the model's performance.

Given the varying scales of our features, I'll standardize them. This process will transform the features to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1, ensuring that no particular feature disproportionately influences the models.

Model Training

I'll train various regression models:

Simple Linear Regression: This will serve as a baseline model.
Ridge Regression: Useful for preventing overfitting, especially when multicollinearity is present.
Lasso Regression: This can help in feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero.
Elastic Net Regression: A combination of Ridge and Lasso, it balances the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods.
Polynomial Regression with Regularization: To capture non-linear relationships in the data.
Neural Network: A more complex model that can capture intricate patterns in the data.
With the exception of simple linear regression, I'll tune the hyperparameters of these models using the training set.

Model Evaluation

After training, I'll evaluate the models' performances on the training set using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). This metric will guide me in selecting the best two models.

Finally, only the top two models will be evaluated on the test set. This will provide an unbiased estimate of their performance on unseen data.

In conclusion, this analysis aims to provide a comprehensive approach to predicting the heating load of buildings based on their characteristics. Through rigorous preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation, I aspire to select the best models for this task.
